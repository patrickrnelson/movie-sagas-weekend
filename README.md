Redux - Movie Gallery

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Challenge_

The sixth weekend challenge of Prime Digital Academy. The challenge was to use React.js/Redux to display a list of movies, click on a movie to view more information about it, and include a form for users to create a new movie item in the list.
